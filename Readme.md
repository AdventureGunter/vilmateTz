Hi, you are at simple mail-box api!!! :)

First thing you have to do - install packages. To do this type "npm i" in console.
Then you need to run the project. To do this type "npm run local-server" in console. Your server will be listening at port 3000.
To see documentation, you need to go to rout "localhost:3000/api/doc"

This project was made without view, because functionality need testing and approval.
